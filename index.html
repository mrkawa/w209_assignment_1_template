      The data does not seem to indicate a meaningful relationship between stated age and rating.  Of course the data is highly subjective in nature and any insights drawn are indicative only of my personal preferences.  
      <br /><br />
      The data was collected gradually over the course of nearly 6 years, during which time I assigned a rating in increments of 0.5 on a scale of 0.5 to 5 to every unique whisky I tasted.  The  entire dataset is 757 records in length, however most whiskies in the set do not state the age of the product on the label.  
	  <br /><br />
	  Although it is often possible to make an educated guess as to the actual age of the contents of a No Age Statement (NAS) bottle based on context, laws, public statements, and conjecture, the only way to be legally certain of the age of a whisky is for it to be printed on the bottle.  For the purposes of this visualization, most NAS whiskies were omitted, unless the age is clearly advertised in their marketing materials or legally required to be at least a certain age (e.g. Bottled in Bond).
